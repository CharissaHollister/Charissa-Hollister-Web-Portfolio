            I graduated from University of Wisconsin-Madison with a Bachelor of
            Science in Biology. After working in the laboratory for a number of
            years I migrated to assisting with spreadsheet and software
            validation/implementation; This is how I discovered my passion for
            developing using coding and data processing techniques.

            Recently earned a certificate in full stack development from the
            University of Central Florida in Coding, with newly developed skills
            in JavaScript, CSS, React.js, and responsive web design. I am known
            for having an innovative problem solver passionate about coding with
            a focus on data processing and process harmonization. With each
            project, my aim is to improve the quality and efficiency without
            losing data integrity for an ideal user experience. I applied
            aspects of Visual Basic, Crystal Reports and Excel macro development
            in a recent project. I was lead for this project working with an
            internal team and software consultants to develop and implement an
            updated data processing method utilizing the software program
            LabWare LIMS. Iâ€™m excited to leverage my skills as part of a
            fast-paced, quality-driven team to build better and always improving
            data processing experiences.
